# Crow Releases

I use this public repo to host builds of my game for the ease of playtesters.

If you found this by mistake congratz! you're more than welcome to test the game. Note: These builds are not the automated ones and are added manually by yours truly for our playtesting events. let me know what you think by creating an [Issue](https://github.com/joshandersn/crow-releases/issues)

Downloads are in the [Release Tab](https://github.com/joshandersn/crow-releases/releases)
